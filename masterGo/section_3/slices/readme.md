# Time To Practice: Slices

## Task 1: Appending through a pointer

appendOne is a simple function that takes a pointer to a slice of ints and appends a 1 to this slice.

```go
package main

func appendOne(s *[]int) {
	*s = append(*s, 1)
}

func main() {
	s1 := []int{0, 0, 0, 0}
	// s1 := make([]int, 4, 8) // capacity is twice the initial size
	s2 := s1
	fmt.Printf("Before appendOne:\ns1: %v\ns2: %v\n", s1, s2)
	appendOne(&s1)
	fmt.Printf("After appendOne:\ns1: %v\ns2: %v\n", s1, s2)
	s1[0] = 2
	fmt.Printf("After changing s1:\ns1: %v\ns2: %v\n", s1, s2)

}
```

Does appendOne(&s2) also change s1?

Create a new .go file, add the above code, and run the file via go run.

Then change the first two lines of main() to:

```go
// s1 := []int{0, 0, 0, 0}
s1 := make([]int, 4, 8) // capacity is twice the initial size
```

Repeat the test.

If one of the results (or both) is different from what you expected, inspect the properties of s1 and s2 (address,
length and capacity) - they might give you a hint about whatâ€™s going on.

## Task 2: The slice is copied! Or is it?

Go has pass-by-value semantics, as we learned in the lecture about functions and pointers. The following code passes a
slice to the function changeSlice(). The slice is not passed as a pointer like in the first task, so apparently it is
passed by value, and the local variable s is therefore just a copy of s1 that is passed to changeSlice() in main().

```go
package main

func changeSlice1(s []int) {
	s[0] = 7
}

func main() {
	s1 := []int{1}
	fmt.Println("s1 before changeSlice1:", s1)
	changeSlice1(s1)
	fmt.Println("s1 after changeSlice1:", s1)
}
```

Still, assigning a new value to s[0] changes the value of s1[0] as well.

Why?

## Task 3: A little change

A slight modification of task #2: Instead of assigning a new value to s[0], we set s to a new slice of ints. Now s1 is
not affected by the change.

```go
package main

func changeSlice2(s []int) {
	s = []int{7}
}

func main() {
	s1 := []int{1}
	fmt.Println("s1 before changeSlice2:", s1)
	changeSlice2(s1)
	fmt.Println("s1 after changeSlice2:", s1)
}
```

Why does this behave differently than the code in task #2?

## Task 4: An append() gotcha

The built-in function append() is a convenient way of appending data to a slice without worrying about the capacity. But
in the code below it does not seem to work as intended:

```go
package main

func main() {
	src := []int{}
	src = append(src, 0)
	src = append(src, 1)
	src = append(src, 2)
	dest1 := append(src, 3)
	dest2 := append(src, 4)
	fmt.Println(src, dest1, dest2)
}
```

Run this code and inspect the output. What would you have expected? Why do you see this result instead?
